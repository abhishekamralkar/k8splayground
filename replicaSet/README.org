#+Title: Kubernetes ReplicaSet: nginx-replicaset

This repository contains the Kubernetes YAML file to deploy a ReplicaSet for an nginx. The ReplicaSet ensures that a specified number of replicas (pods) of the application are running at all times.

Deployments allow you to run one or more pods in a flexible configuration, defining how many replicas of the pods need to run, on which types of nodes they should schedule (for example via taints and tolerations), and the deployment pattern (for example, Recreate or Rolling deployment).

*  Usage

** Apply the ReplicaSet configuration to your Kubernetes cluster:

#+begin_src bash
kubectl apply -f replicaset.yaml
#+end_src

** Verify deployment

#+begin_src bash
kubectl get replicaset
kubectl get pods
kubectl describe replicaset nginx
#+end_src

** Scale deployment

#+bagin_src bash
# Scale up to 5 replicas
kubectl scale replicaset nginx-replicaset --replicas=5

# Scale down to 2 replicas
kubectl scale replicaset nginx-replicaset --replicas=2
#+end_src
